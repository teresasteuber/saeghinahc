Hi everybody! My partners CAT S60 phone is looping through the start up screen, when it turns on it shows the CAT S60 logo and has a yellow loading bar, it loads and then just stays on this screen, every now and then it will move from this to the phone security login, we add the number then it goes through the CAT S60 loading screen all over again.

I recently got a Phantom 3 quadcopter so I also picked up a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8"4 as it was on sale at Best Buy. All I did on the device is install 1 application, DJI Pilot App. But the video lagged like crazy, it was like watching stop motion. I installed Google Now Launcher and disabled or uninstalled anything and everything I could (and was allowed to disable). I turned on developer options and got rid of any animations, and I turned on "Force GPU rendering." All this helped. Please see the Edits at the bottom of this post This is a collection of links and recommendations for optimizing for lag and battery life on the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. There may be some carrier specific information here so stay frosty on changes based on carrier information. This is focused on the AT&T version, please add T-Mobile and Sprint, etc bloatware to the comments and I will update. Before I start off with the changes we need to make to this phone Hey, guys! I have a question about a Samsung Galaxy Tab E (SM-T377P) that a friend gave me. I followed this ( tutorial to reset it, but it wasn't enough. I guess I have to enter the original account information and I don't have that. Is there an easy way around this? Thanks in advance!. So a while back I asked if others were having problems with Wi-fi calling (https://www.reddit.com/r/HTC10/comments/4jolda/wifi_calling_not_working_with_tmobile/). It never worked and only reported Error ER081. Additionally I had problems sending/receiving MMS messages when connected to a wifi network. It would either fail to send one, or show a download error. I'd then have to turn off wifi, send/download the message, then turn wifi back on. TL;DR: Take out your T-Mobile SIM card, perform.

So, just to preface, I want to make it abundantly clear that I am incredibly clueless in regards to issues (or simple function for that matter) of my phone. I have a T-Mobile LG Optimus L90, So, last night, my phone died while I was studying. I plugged it in to charge it and tried turning it back on when it had a little bit of batter. However, it got stuck on the T-Mobile icon that pops up when powering on the phione. It was stuck on this screen for probably 5 minutes. So I held the power.  
Hey all, I've been trying to find even a semi-viable solution online for days now and no luck. The first day I got my pixel 3 xl the buds worked great, amazing. Ever since that day they don't work lol. When I plug them in the volume control works, but the pause/play/Google assistant doesn't and they play sound through the speakers. I had the same (ish) issue with my Pixel 2 XL with the dongle, went through about 4 of em from Google before I gave up, same story, worked for a day, then wouldn't. Girfriend and I both have Pixel 2 XLs. Her phone died last night so she plugged it in. When plugged in, it shows the battery icon and that it's charging. Then the screen flashes and goes away. She says it got wet in the rain so had her soak it in rice overnight. Still does the same screen/won't charge. Any suggestions. So my daughter locked herself out of my old Sony Xperia (I believe it's model T, it is the James Bond phone released a few years back). She changed her lockscreen password and forgot it. I looked online for a solution, but nothing works. Tired with Sony PC companion, but the phone is no longer supported, as per the live chat Sony guy. There is no sim card in the phone, she only uses it as an mp3 player and a few apps. Is there any way I can reset the phone, or did she brick. 
I plugged it in with a non Samsung charger if that makes a difference. I have been using Alcatel One Touch 7024W as a temporary phone for a week. Recently, something caused the phone to reboot non stop. I don't mean it turns on, works for a while then reboots. It literally turns on, instantly reboots again and so on until the battery is dead. Because of that, I am unable to troubleshoot, mess around with cached data, scan for antivirus or anything. I realize I may just have to flash the device and lose all the information which MIGHT fix the problem. Are you looking for a FACTORY RESET solution ? HARDRESET.info is bigest TUTORIAL database.
